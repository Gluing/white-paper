# GLUING - White Paper

## The Gluing Project

Gluing allows you to create fabulous NFT from your image or photo by selecting a model, proposed by our artists, which will sublimate it.

Create your memories on the blockchain and keep them preciously or offer them as gifts!

The generated NFTs will be initially stored in clear on the blockchain, it will not be possible to create a private NFT from the start.

The "public" NFTs will be validated by the Gluing team according to a charter of use of the service (no pornographic pictures, etc). This will be possible thanks to a smart-contract, which will wait for validation before generating the NFT and transferring the funds.

An exclusive partnership will also allow us to offer an optional holographic physical version of your NFT...

Finally, an online editor will allow you to interact directly with your NFT template by adding different filters or effects!

## The Blockchain

A Blockchain infrastructure faithful to the essence of the technology : open source, decentralized and democratic;

* A service that is accessible and usable by the general public, with a focus on optimized user experiences around everyday man-machine interfaces: web and mobile applications.
* An economic model of the Gluing Blockchain native token offering investors a clear, fair and directly correlated value creation path to the success of the project;

These principles are implemented thanks to the GLUING Blockchain which allows the storage and the secure transmission of NFTs on many blockchains.

## Use case: Offer a personalized NFT

Thanks to the Gluing application, import your image, select a limited template, and receive your personalized NFT or transmit it directly to your friend !

## Development ecosystem

The Gluing Blockchain is still under study, several partnerships are possible to easily include other new features to come.

## Smart Contracts and transfer protocols

Several transmission protocols are developed as Smart Contracts by Gluing. Thus, Dapps can be created and can use these transfer protocols.

### dApps

The Solidity language will be used to manage smart contracts. Smart contracts allow to execute functions on the blockchain and offer the possibility to the community to develop applications on the Gluing blockchain.

## 7. Workflow of Gluing NFTs

The GLuing blockchain uses NFTs as "memory media". Before creating a custom NFT, the user must provision his GLUING Coin wallet and must purchase a Gluing compatible NFT.

From a Gluing Blockchain perspective, a NFT creation consists of:

* Provisioning the servers that host the data to ensure they are paid for renting the storage space over time.
* Customize the NFT by sending an image and selecting a template;
* Select the destination blockchain
* Validate and create the NFT;
* Sending the NFT to the chosen recipient;

## NFT structure and files

Non-fungible tokens (NFT)
The Non-fungible-token module provides basic functions to create and manage NFTs such as create_class, transfer, mint, burn, destroy_class. Gluing uses NFTs as custom memories.

The most common NFTs are the ERC721, We can add inside the metas we want and in our case.

The first NFT models will be designed by Gluing and an NFT marketplace will be deployed in 2022. This marketplace allows any creator to have the possibility to propose and sell NFT models compatible with Gluing.

## Business Model

The GLUING is the token of the Gluing blockchain. Transactions made on the Gluing blockchain are settled in GLUING i.e. the creation of NFT

The volume of demand for NFTs on the one hand, and for their storage over time on the other hand, are the two levers of GLUING appreciation on the secondary markets.
